            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHO are made Partakers of the Love, Life and Power of God, by turning to and believing in the Glorious Light of Chriſt Jeſus, the Only Begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth; My Dear and Stedfaſt Love is to you all: I am daily more and more effected with the Power of God manifeſted in you, and the living Operation of it, as it bleſſedly appears, to turn eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of you from the Evil of your Wayes, to God, and his Glorious, Living and Standing Way, which blaſts and ſtains, and yet will more and more blaſt and ſtain all other Wayes, and the ſeeming Glory of them that are dead, and keep people in Death, and from the Path of Life, which leads to Life, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves in the pure Life of Jeſus, the Son of God, and brings out of the Unſtableneſs, Error &amp; Going Aſtray, to have the Heart fixed upon the Lord God, and to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:108152:3"/>love and live in the Immortal Truth of God, which was before Error, Falſhood &amp; Going Aſtray was. You that are come to know this bleſſed Way of Truth, O love it, love it for evermore; ſee that you err not by wandring or ſtraying from it, or turning aſide into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny By-path, and ſo loſe your firſt Love, and fall from your firſt Stedfaſtneſs; for, the Way of Truth is a ſtedfaſt ſtanding Way, over all the falſe wayes, who ever wander or periſh from it, it ſtands and remains the ſame forever, and is the Path of the Juſt, that ſhines, and ſhall ſhine more and more unto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Day, over all the wayes of the Wicked and paths of the Unjuſt, and all the envious Perſecutors, that tear after their Prey, hurting and deſtroying one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in the falſe unprofitable Ways &amp; barren Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, where long they have wandered from Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>the Way, the Truth and the Life;</hi> and ſo are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes kept from God, and the Knowledge of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Way. But Glory to God forever.
<hi>Dear Friends,</hi> the Only True God you know, and Chriſt Jeſus, whom he hath ſent to lead to himſelf, and to lead out of the World, its Wayes Faſhions, Cuſtoms and the Wickedneſs that the World lieth in. So, look not back again in the leaſt Degree to
<hi>Egypt</hi>'s Wayes, the vain and unprofitable Wayes, Words, Manners, Faſhions, Cuſtoms or Traditions of the <hi>Heathen</hi> that know not God, but lie in their Wickedneſs, adding Sin to Sin, bringing up one Vain Way, Faſhion, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom and Tradition after another, which pleaſeth and taketh up the vain looſe Mind, that loves to be at eaſe in the Fleſh, and lives above the Croſs of Chriſt;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108152:3"/>ſuch love beſt the broad way, wherein, though they have a little Eaſe for a few dayes, but if they Repent not, they will aſſuredly meet with <hi>Death and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction everlaſtingly, as a Reward due to them for loving and walking in the broad way of Sin, and hating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing the Way of Life.</hi> Therefore keep out of the World's wayes, keep out of the way of the Ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which leads from keeping in the daily Croſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the luſts of the world, faſhions of the world, words of the world, the luſts of the fleſh and pride of life; theſe things you know are not of God, our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but they are of the world, and kept up in the love and by the ſpirit of the world, and the world paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth away, its ſpirit is ſeen by you; as you keep in the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, you are kept out of the world's ſpirit, that luſts to Envy and after evil things: This ſpirit keeps people walking after their ungodly Luſts, one luſting after one Evil, and another after another Evil Thing: And by this ſpirit how is Sin committed with Greedineſs, and Men and Womens Reins let looſe to act all manner of Wickedneſs, and to run into every Evil they luſt after! ſo that many ſeem without Bridle to ſtay them from any ſenſual Deſire that by the ſpirit of the world ariſeth in them. Therefore, <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> you Children of God and of his Day, be wiſe and ſober, alwayes having God's Fear before your Eyes; Let none of you in the leaſt adhere to the ſpirit of the world, that draws back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, and love of the things of the world a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſuch will have an Eye out towards world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Delights &amp; Pleaſures, and be taken up therewith;
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108152:4"/>then the ſweet ſavoury words are loſt, &amp; ſo the ſenſe of Life is loſt alſo, the Pleaſures that ſuch have had in the Truth they loſe the lively ſenſe of; then is the Enemy let in as a Flood, and the Spirit of God not felt to lift up a Standard againſt him; ſo the Soul's Enemy prevails greatly againſt ſuch, to the loſing of their firſt Love and Stedfaſtneſs they had to God, and his Truth and People; and when the firſt Love to God is left, there is a Loſs of Stedfaſtneſs in the Truth of God, and the Work of the Day not well minded, but the Mind after the World, and the things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and that beſets and clogs, and ſo lieth ſo heavy upon the Conſcience that it darkens, hardens, and if not laid aſide in due time, ſears the Conſcience, that hath been good and tender. Now, them who are in that State, can take up that which they once did lay down for Truth's ſake, and in Obedience to its Requirings, building again the things they deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and matter not whether they keep to the true Language or not, but will ſpeak it to faithful Friends and not to others, and ſo uſe their Liberty (as may be they call it) as an Occaſion to the Fleſh, in Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Words and Falſe Language, contrary to <hi>Thee</hi> and <hi>Thou</hi> to a Particular, which was the Language of all the Holy Men of God mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and <hi>You</hi> to more then one, or many; but ſome can take up an Eaſe in ſpeaking <hi>You</hi> to one, but its fleſhly, and not ſpiritual, it is of the Earth, and is earthly, and renders them to be at Eaſe in <hi>Sion:</hi> and this is written in the Love of God, That every one profeſſing the Truth of God, that have uſed ſuch a
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:108152:4"/>Liberty, may deny themſelves of it, and take up a daily Croſs to it, that ſo that Liberty may be ſeen to be Bondage to the god &amp; ſpirit of this world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Unfaithful to the Truth of God are vailed, and ſo keep not clear nor pure their Conſciences towards God or men, as to the Language of Truth, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs therein: Certainly God's holy Spirit is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, eſpecially with thoſe who have been long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the pure Truth of God, and yet give ſuch way to the Enemy's Temptations, as that thereby they are kept out of the Language of Truth; ſo not being faithful in a little, or the leſſer things, that God hath by his Spirit led his People into, &amp; bleſſed them in, how can ſuch expect to be Rulers over much, or ſee much of the Glory of God, that he hath revealed in theſe latter dayes?</p>
            <p>And <hi>Dear Brethren and Siſters,</hi> ſeeing you are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a holy Calling unto Liberty, let none uſe it as an Occaſion to the Fleſh; let not the Liberty you uſe be fleſhly, but ſpiritual; then none will take li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in Words or Actions contrary to the Truth, and the Spirit that led you into it; nor none will be Heady or High-minded, for that is out of Truth and the Spirit of it, and goes before a Fall, and they are not near in Relation to God, nor like unto Chriſt Jeſus, that are High-minded; neither do they feel the Lord to dwell in them and with them, although they may have Taſtes of his Goodneſs, and be ſenſible of his Power at ſome times. Now, it is the Heady and High-minded that will not ſubmit to the Spirit's Rule, Order and Government in the Heart, and ſo
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:108152:5"/>would ſet up ſomething of Fleſh, ſomething of Man, and rob the Spirit and Power of God of what belongs thereunto, and ſo all the bad Rule and Diſorder in Government got up, and is kept up in the World; Fleſh would rule, and have the Preeminence inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and outwardly; and who are High-minded, they love to have the Preeminence, they love Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Superiority above their Fellow Servants, and will ſmite them that are of lower degree, whom they ought to cheriſh and condeſcend unto: Now ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I would have no man to think of himſelf otherwayes then what is meet, but every one to think lowly of himſelf, to abaſe and humble himſelf, as did our Lord and Maſter-Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> A lively Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern for all to look at, to be ſo minded, and to follow his Steps, in his Humiliation, and enduring the Croſs patiently, deſpiſing all the Shame and Reproach he met with whilſt in a viſible Body of Fleſh in the world. Friends, he hath left us an Example, that we all might follow his ſteps, and mark his ſteps, that never ſtept into any Evil, nor was Guile found in his Mouth; &amp; there will be no Headineſs then, there will be no giving way to the Luſts of the world, the luſts of the Fleſh nor the Pride of Life, but all that (with the Light &amp; Spirit of Grace) will be ſeen, and judg'd to be out of the Steps of Chriſt, that we are required to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſo the things come to be purſued and followed which make for Peace in the particular and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: ſo all high Thoughts and Vain Conceits will be judged down, and ſhut out with the Power of the Living God; and all Exceſs and Unneceſſary Things,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:108152:5"/>uſed by any that profeſs the Truth, either in Meats Drinks, or Apparel, will be denyed and come out, of; and there will be no faſhioning themſelves like the World, nor getting into their Fantaſtick Garbs, and fooliſh vain Faſhions, as they are brought in, but all will be kept to modeſt and plain Attire, ſuch as becomes the Truth of God, and was in times p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

You are the Lord's Jewels (my dear Friends and Brethren) O you are the purified! It's you that are made Holy Veſſels fit for God, and his Heavenly Treaſure, and that retain the Heavenly Treaſure in your Earthen Veſſels, it's you that come to walk with God in white; for you are worthy, when ſome walk after their Ungodly Luſts, and after the Courſe of the World, <hi>whoſe God is their Belly, who glory in their Shame, and mind Earthly Things.</hi> Therefore as any Root of

There is a Time of Weakneſs, Inability and Feebleneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are Fathers, or grown to a Young-man's State in Chriſt Jeſus; there is much to dye unto; there muſt not only be a dying to open, prophane, groſs Evils, thoſe muſt not only be ſlain, but ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Wickedneſs in High Places; the Rulers of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and every thing that would exalt it ſelf againſt the Appearance of God in us, muſt be warred and wreſtled with, and it muſt be conquered and ſlain; then we appear as ſtrong in the Lord, and know the

And they that come to the Truth, and grow in it, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Truth will quench the Fiery Paſſions of ſuch as are ſoon Angry.</p>
            <p>And Friends, as you grow in the Truth, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Childiſhneſs and Imperfection you will all come out of, you will all grow out of, and wholely dye unto, and the Toſſings will be over, and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts will ceaſe, and you will all come to, and be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in that Reſt that is glorious, and be kept in perfect Union with God, and one with another.</p>
            <p>And let all Raiſers of Evil Reports, and Broach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them, be found out and checkt, ſo far as it tends to ſtir up Strife, and cauſe Diviſion in the Church; let ſuch be marked, and avoid them, as not worthy of having Fellowſhip with, that they may be aſhamed that are found to raiſe up an Evil Report againſt any of God's People, or ſowing of Diſcord amongſt Brethren, buſying themſelves in hearing Evil and ſpeaking Evil: Do not judge one another upon Reports, before the Report be fully ſought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and found out to be true; then let Judgment go forth according to Goſpel Order, that Sin may not remain upon thy Brother, nor thou to put a Stumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-block in thy Brother's way, to cauſe him to ſtumble, by the reporting that which is falſe, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:108152:13"/>judging him thereupon: That Judgment, paſſed upon Falſe Reports, will return back upon ſuch as give it. The Judgments of the Lord are true, and there is no Unrighteouſneſs in them; he judges no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is for Judgment: and that which is for Judgment ought to be judged, where ever it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. I would not have that ſpared in any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, which cauſeth Diviſion in the Church of God; for that weakens themſelves, and hurts others.</p>
            <p>Tale-bearers work againſt the Truth, and may weaken ſome Members in the Church; but that Work communicates no Divine Strength to the Body nor any Member thereof: for my own particular, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could well digeſt ſuch, ſince I had any Knowledge how to put a Difference betwixt Good and Evil.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Dear Friends and Brethren,</hi> I exhort you as a Brother in Love, All to follow the things that make for Peace, follow after Righteouſneſs, and feel the Righteous Judgments of God to take place upon all that which is contrary to God in every particular: O live in Love, &amp; be at Peace one with another: Love thinks no Evil, ſpeaks no Evil, carryes no Tales or Evil Reports; it ſuffers long, and hopeth all things, and beareth all things, and vaunteth not it ſelf, nor is eaſily puffed up. God Almighty keep you all ſtedfaſt in the Love of God, and one another. You know, Love is of God, and that you ought to dwell in it: O! dwell in Love, then you dwell in God, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hurt one another, nor can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for it; then there is not many Maſters, nor ſtriving for Maſtery, nor many Minds, but all in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:108152:13"/>the one Mind of the Lord, and he alone exalted, and of one Heart in the one Spirit, minding the ſame things, and cleaving to and following whatſoever things are lovely, honeſt and of good report; then thou wilt be one with the Flock of God, in all theſe things, that tend ſo much to the Honour of God, and keeping all ſweet and ſavoury, and wilt mind the Foot-ſteps of the Flock of God, and follow the Lord fully.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Dear Friends</hi> every where, Keep up your Meetings in the Name and Power of the Lord God, who hath owned us, and been with us in all our Suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for his Name's ſake; let none deny his Name, nor bring a Reproach upon his Name, by any Unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in any part of your Teſtimony, which you are called to bear for his Name and Truth: O meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as your former manner was, although ye ſhould meet with greater Tryals and Sufferings then formerly; look not thereat, but look at that Arm and Power of God which formerly ſaved and delivered us, and is able to ſave to the uttermoſt from whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Devil and all his Agents can do againſt us: For, O how hath the Arm and Power of the Lord prevailed againſt the Power of the Devil, and his working through many of his Inſtruments, that have appeared againſt the Truth of God, and our meeting together in the Name &amp; Power of the Lord! And how have we witneſſed Chriſt Jeſus in us and amongſt us greater then he that is in the World, who as a ſtrong man armed hath wrought in many Profeſſors. Prophane and Apoſtates, againſt the glorious Truth

Therefore have many been angry with us, and with great Madneſs and Enmity have endeavoured our Overthrow and Ruin, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from meeting together, as our former man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hath been, to wait upon God, and to ſerve and worſhip him in Spirit and Truth, as he requires of us; for this have many been enraged againſt us, and ſet themſelves againſt Chriſt's Appearance in us, and our worſhipping of him in Spirit and Truth; but many of their wicked Devices, which they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed againſt us, hath God confounded and brought to nought; and this our Eyes have ſeen brought to paſs, to the Wo and Torment of many of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of Truth, and us the People of God, who meet together in it.</p>
            <p>Therefore, <hi>Dear Friends,</hi> be you all incouraged to meet together in the Fear of the Lord, ſitting down together in the Heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus; ſo as you have felt, you will more and more feel, <hi>his Name as precious Oyntment poured forth;</hi> and he will anoint you with freſh Oyl, and you will be made Partakers with him of his Joy and Gladneſs; and let no Backwardneſs or Careleſneſs, nor a ſleight E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem appear in any of you, in meeting together: For that Spirit that would cool thy Love to, or any wayes leſſen thy eſteem of the Meetings of the Saints and People of God, where they meet together in his Name and to do his Will, this ſpirit is not of God,
